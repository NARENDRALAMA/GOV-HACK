- **Multi-Life Event Support**: Handle birth registration, unemployment, disaster recovery, and carer support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: Modern, responsive web interface with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async support
- **Agentic AI**: Intelligent agent with natural language understanding and autonomous workflow execution
- **RAG**: Government datasets integration (NSW BDM, ABS demographics, service locations)
- **Orchestration**: Multi-step workflow planning and execution with life event detection
- **Automation**: Playwright skeleton for headless form filling across multiple services
- **Data Models**: Pydantic with comprehensive validation for multiple life events
- **Privacy**: Vault-based storage with automatic TTL cleanup

Each life event gets a tailored journey plan with appropriate government services.

```bash
# Replace {journey_id} with the ID from step 1
curl "http://localhost:8000/plan/{journey_id}"
```

**Expected Response**: Complete journey with pending steps.
